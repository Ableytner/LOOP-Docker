# Install packages for frontend

Using yarn instead of npm, because npm is currently broken:
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/13715

npm released version 19.0 and dependencies require version 18.0 at the moment. While this error persists, use **yarn** instead of **npm**

## Installing yarn

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

## Adding package

```bash
yarn add <package-name>
```

## Starting frontend

```bash
yarn start
```
